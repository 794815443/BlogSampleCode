# BlogSampleCode
This is the code repository for all the sample codes in my blogs.
You can find the blogs corresponding to these codes in my Jianshu pages: [AC3's Blogs](http://www.jianshu.com/users/2c57671fa68b/latest_articles)

### 1) UIViewOperation:
Originally, we would like to operate the UIView's layout by manipulating the frame of the view. But in some cases, there would be better to operate the UIView by manipulating the autolayout constraints to adjust the frame of the view indirectly.

### 2) UIViewControllerTranstition
There are multiple ways to transit different views by UIViewController APIs. I summarized these ways and show you how they work.

### 3) TableTest
In this sample, I show you some key technology to create customize tableviews as well as some tricky skill to avoid errors.

### 4) VIPERTest
VIPER is a new architecture for app design. I build a test project to have a try of using VIPER to create a simple app. Wish you get the core idea of VIPER concept in this sample and refresh your understanding of the common MVC architecture.

### 5) ScrollTest
ScrollTest is a demo that shows the basic gesture processing logic in UIScrollView. Understanding this logic would make it easy to implement gesture handling on the subview of the UIScrollView.

### 6) ShadowTest
A demo which is designed to indicate the relation between view and layer when processing the round coner and shadow, with a bunch of switches that control different properties, making different effects. Also it tries to show the overoll effect when doing round coner and shadow in scroll view. And how it effect the performance when using resterization or not.

### 7) iPaintTest
I worte a demo which is similar to an official demo presented on WWDC2012 Session 506 - "optimizing 2D graphic and animation performance". I will show different optimizations of 2D graphic performance in this demo.
